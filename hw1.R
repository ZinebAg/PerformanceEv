######     is doubling a good idea ? / trying to find an engineering rule


#by doubling access points, it will reduce the collision probability. Doubling the number of access points results in 
#more succesfull download requests for smaller values C (peaks at 500) but seems to be less efficient for 
#larger number requests. This peaking pattern can also be seen while measuring the pps. For delays, less
#servers seem to be more optimal since the scatterplot is convex/flatter.

#one rule can that when there's less than let's say 500 requests, have more servers. Once we go pass the threshold
# (500), we shut some servers. 

#Still problem with the collision 

# aussi le cotÃ© linÃ©aire !! try to identify as a function of the number of requests per second, C,
#what should be the number of servers, S, and access points, AP, such that there is a linear growth in
#the throughput


#with data i have already
